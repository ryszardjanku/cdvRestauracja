## Rabbit Ragout

Ingredients:

800g rabbit meat, cut into pieces
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 large onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 carrots, diced
2 celery stalks, diced
200ml dry white wine
400ml chicken broth
2 bay leaves
A few sprigs of fresh thyme
Salt and pepper to taste
Instructions:

In a bowl, toss the pieces of meat with flour, salt, and pepper to coat.
Heat olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the meat pieces and brown them on both sides until golden. Transfer the meat to a plate.
In the same pot, add chopped onion and garlic, sauté for a few minutes until softened.
Add carrots and celery, sauté for another few minutes.
Pour in the wine, cook for a while to evaporate the alcohol.
Return the meat to the pot, add chicken broth, bay leaves, and thyme. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for about 1.5 - 2 hours until the meat is tender.
Season with salt and pepper to taste towards the end of cooking.
Serve hot with your favorite accompaniments such as mashed potatoes, couscous, or bread.

## Tart with Seasonal Fruits

Ingredients:

Crust:

200g all-purpose flour
100g cold butter, diced
2 tablespoons powdered sugar
A pinch of salt
2-3 tablespoons cold water
Filling:

Seasonal fruits (e.g., strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, peaches), cut into pieces
2 tablespoons sugar
Juice of half a lemon
2 tablespoons cornstarch or corn flour (for thickening the juice)
Instructions:

Preheat the oven to 180°C.
In a large bowl, mix the flour, powdered sugar, and salt. Add the diced butter and gently rub the ingredients with your fingers until crumbly. Gradually add water, stirring, until the dough starts to form.
Roll out the dough on a floured surface and shape it into a round form. Transfer the dough to a tart pan, gently pressing it into the bottom and sides. Trim off any excess dough with a knife.
In a bowl, toss the fruits with sugar and lemon juice. Sprinkle the fruits with cornstarch or corn flour to thicken the juice.
Pour the fruits onto the prepared crust, spreading them evenly over the surface.
Bake the tart in the preheated oven for about 30-35 minutes or until the edges of the crust are golden brown and the fruits are soft and juicy.
After baking, remove the tart from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes.
Serve the tart warm or cold, preferably dusted lightly with powdered sugar or served with a scoop of ice cream.
